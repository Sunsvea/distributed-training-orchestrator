## üõ†Ô∏è Customization Options

### Modify Demo Parameters
Edit `demo_orchestrator.py`:
```python
config = DemoConfig(
    initial_workers=3,        # Starting number of workers
    coordinator_port=50051,   # Coordinator port
    dashboard_port=8080,      # Dashboard port
    training_epochs=100,      # Training duration
    batch_size=32,           # Training batch size
    learning_rate=0.001,     # Learning rate
    model_type="mnist_cnn"   # Model architecture
)
```

### Add Custom Scenarios
Extend the `DemoScenario` enum and implement in `_execute_scenario()`:
```python
class DemoScenario(Enum):
    CUSTOM_SCENARIO = "custom_scenario"

async def _execute_scenario(self, scenario: DemoScenario):
    elif scenario == DemoScenario.CUSTOM_SCENARIO:
        await self._custom_scenario()
```

### Custom Metrics
Add your own metrics to the performance monitor:
```python
performance_monitor.add_custom_metric("custom_metric", value)
```

## üìù Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port Already in Use**
   - Change ports in `DemoConfig`
   - Kill existing processes: `lsof -ti:8080 | xargs kill`

2. **WebSocket Connection Issues**
   - Check firewall settings
   - Ensure no proxy interference
   - Try different browsers

3. **Workers Not Connecting**
   - Verify coordinator is running
   - Check network connectivity
   - Review logs for gRPC errors

### Performance Tuning

1. **Reduce Resource Usage**
   - Decrease `collection_interval` in performance monitor
   - Reduce `initial_workers` count
   - Lower `batch_size` in training

2. **Increase Responsiveness**
   - Reduce WebSocket broadcast interval
   - Increase `heartbeat_interval`
   - Optimize chart update frequency
